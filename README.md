## Overview

I have completed advanced dom project of JavaScript Zero to Expert course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. In this project, I have applied the skills and knowledge gained from the course to create a dynamic and interactive web application.

## Project Highlights

- **DOM Manipulation**: I have mastered the art of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. This includes working with event listeners, event bubbling and capturing, event delegation, and traversing through the DOM to create dynamic and responsive web pages.

- **Intersection Observer API**: I have utilized the Intersection Observer API to create animations triggered by scrolling. This adds a visually appealing and interactive element to the website, making it more engaging for users.

- **Tabbed Component**: I have implemented a tabbed component that allows users to switch between different sections of content within a single webpage. This enhances the user experience by organizing and presenting information in a structured manner.

- **Sticky Navbar**: I have designed and implemented a sticky navigation bar that remains fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls. This provides easy navigation and enhances the overall usability of the website.

- **Slider**: I have created a slider component that allows users to view and interact with a series of images or content in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.

- **Lazy Image Loading**: To optimize website performance, I have incorporated lazy image loading. This technique defers the loading of images until they are within the user's viewport, reducing initial page load times.
